   <h2>Anatomy</h2>
    <p>All anglerfish are carnivorous and are thus adapted for the capture of prey. Ranging in color from dark gray to dark brown, deep-sea species have large heads that bear enormous, crescent-shaped mouths full of long, fang-like teeth angled inward for efficient prey grabbing. Their length can vary from 2–18 cm (1–7 in), with a few types getting as large as 100 cm (39 in),but this variation is largely due to sexual dimorphism, with females being much larger than males.Frogfish and other shallow-water anglerfish species are ambush predators, and often appear camouflaged as rocks, sponges or seaweed.</p>
